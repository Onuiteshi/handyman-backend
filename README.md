## üóÉÔ∏è Database Design

The database is designed with a unified authentication system and role-based profiles:

### Core Models

#### 1. User (Unified Authentication)
- Central authentication table for all user types
- Handles email/phone verification and OTP management
- Supports multiple authentication providers (EMAIL, PHONE, GOOGLE)
- Role-based access control (CUSTOMER, ARTISAN, ADMIN)
- JWT token management with refresh tokens

#### 2. Customer
- Extends user functionality for regular customers
- Stores customer-specific preferences and settings
- One-to-one relationship with User

#### 3. Artisan
- Extends user functionality with artisan-specific fields
- Stores professional information (experience, bio, skills, portfolio)
- Tracks online status, location, and verification status
- Has a many-to-many relationship with ServiceCategory
- One-to-one relationship with User

#### 4. ServiceCategory
- Defines different service types (e.g., Plumbing, Electrical, Carpentry)
- Has a many-to-many relationship with Artisan
- Managed by admin users only

#### 5. ArtisanServiceCategory (Junction Table)
- Manages the many-to-many relationship between Artisan and ServiceCategory
- Tracks when categories were added to artisans

#### 6. OTP
- Manages OTP generation, storage, and verification
- Supports different OTP types (SIGNUP, LOGIN, VERIFICATION)
- Includes expiration and usage tracking

### Key Relationships
- One-to-One: User ‚Üî Customer
- One-to-One: User ‚Üî Artisan
- Many-to-Many: Artisan ‚Üî ServiceCategory (through ArtisanServiceCategory)
- One-to-Many: User ‚Üî OTP

### Authentication Flow

#### OTP-based Authentication
1. **Signup**: User provides identifier (email/phone) ‚Üí OTP sent ‚Üí User verifies OTP ‚Üí Account created
2. **Login**: User provides identifier ‚Üí OTP sent ‚Üí User verifies OTP ‚Üí JWT tokens issued
3. **Admin Login**: Admin provides email/password ‚Üí JWT tokens issued

#### OAuth Authentication
1. **Google OAuth**: User provides Google token ‚Üí Account created/authenticated ‚Üí JWT tokens issued

## Security Features

- **OTP-based authentication** for customers and artisans (6-digit codes)
- **Password-based authentication** for admin users only (hashed with bcrypt)
- **Google OAuth integration** for social login
- JWT tokens for session management with refresh token support
- Input validation using express-validator
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- CORS enabled
- Environment variables for sensitive data
- Token expiration and validation
- Secure HTTP headers
- OTP expiration and rate limiting

## Error Handling

The API uses a consistent error response format:
```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Error message",
    "status": 400,
    "details": []
  }
}
```

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive test coverage:
- Unit tests for services and utilities
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Authentication flow testing
- Database operation testing

Run tests with:
```bash
npm test
```
